# Earth Conductivity Project

Implementation of the Boteler 2019 *Analytic Calculation of Geoelectric Fields due to Geomagnetic Disturbances: A Test Case* paper

## Purpose
This repository contains a Julia implementation of the Quebec 5-layer Earth model. The main program (program.jl) has two main functions, load and recreate. 

### Recreate
**Recreate** creates the 5 layer model and recreates tables 4 and 7 from the Boteler paper, the tables generated by their 5 layer model. 

### Load
**Load** loads a csv file, passes the data through the csv file, and outputs another csv file through stdout.


## How To Run
To run, the Julia programming language is required. Install instructions can be found [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

Then, install the required libraries using the following line in the terminal: `julia install.jl`

`julia program.jl [ARGS]`
If run without any args, the program will display a help menu.
