# Earth Conductivity Project

Implementation of the Boteler 2019 *Analytic Calculation of Geoelectric Fields due to Geomagnetic Disturbances: A Test Case* paper

## Purpose
This repository contains a Julia implementation of the Quebec 5-layer Earth model. The main program (program.jl) has two main functions, load and recreate. 

### Recreate
**Recreate** creates the 5 layer model and recreates tables 4 and 7 from the Boteler paper, the tables generated by their 5 layer model. 

### Load
**Load** loads a csv file, passes the data through the csv file, and outputs another csv file through stdout.


## How To Run
To run, the Julia programming language is required. Install by running the following command in the terminal: 
```
sudo snap install julia --classic
```

Then, install the required libraries using the following line in the terminal: 
```
julia install.jl
```

Run the example dataset:
```
julia transfer_sim.jl load data.txt > out.csv
```

or view the help menu:
```
julia transfer_sim.jl
```


To plot the CSV, run the plotter using python3:
```
python3 plot.py
```

## Compiling Paper
```
cd Latex
./build.sh
```
or view the precompiled pdf in the base directory.
